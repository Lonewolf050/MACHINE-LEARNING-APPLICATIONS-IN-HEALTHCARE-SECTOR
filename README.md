# MACHINE-LEARNING-APPLICATIONS-IN-HEALTHCARE-SECTOR
Welcome to the Machine Learning Applications in Healthcare Sector repository! This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to address various challenges and opportunities within the healthcare domain. under this domain i have made heart diseases prediction and will add more disease other than heart .

# Heart Disease Prediction System
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical attributes. The project utilizes popular Python libraries for data manipulation, model building, and visualization.

#Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is carefully examined for missing values and duplicates, which are then handled appropriately.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): A comprehensive analysis of the dataset is performed, including the visualization of feature distributions and correlation matrices.
Model Training: Several machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Decision Tree are trained on the dataset.
Model Evaluation: The accuracy of each model is evaluated on both training and test datasets. Precision-Recall and ROC curves are also plotted for the Logistic Regression model to assess performance.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): A simple GUI application built using Tkinter allows users to input their medical data and receive predictions for heart disease.
GitHub Repository Structure: The repository is well-organized, containing code files, sample dataset, trained models, and a README file providing detailed instructions for usage and setup.
Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip: pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the main Python script (main.py) to execute the heart disease prediction system.
Follow the instructions provided by the GUI to input your medical data and obtain predictions.
